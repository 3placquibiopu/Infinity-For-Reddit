If you have bought the game on Steam or GOG, you can easily install it by following the instructions on the platform's installer. However, if you have the original CD's of the game, you will need to use them to install it on your computer. I am assuming that anyone who has the CD's knows how to use them properly. The vanilla (CD) version of the game has a security feature that requires a CD to run the game. However, you don't need to worry about finding a crack or a patch to bypass this feature, because the mod that we are going to use will come with a custom executable file that automatically removes the need for a CD.

Once you have installed the game, you will need to download the mod that we are going to use. The mod is called **Deus Ex Revision**, and it is a fan-made overhaul of the original game that enhances the graphics, sound, gameplay, and level design. You can download the mod from its official website or from Steam or GOG. The mod also comes with a launcher that lets you customize various settings and options for the game.
  
After you have downloaded and installed the mod, you can launch the game from the mod's launcher or from Steam or GOG. You will notice that the game looks and sounds much better than before, and that some levels have been redesigned or expanded. The mod also adds some new features and fixes some bugs and glitches from the original game. However, the mod does not change the story or the characters of the game, so you can still enjoy the classic Deus Ex experience.
  
I hope you have fun playing Deus Ex with the Revision mod. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and I think the mod makes it even better. If you have any questions or problems with the mod, you can check the FAQ section on the mod's website or contact the mod developers on their forums or social media. Happy gaming!

Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre is a German author and journalist who rose to fame in the late 1990s with his debut novel *Soloalbum*, a witty and cynical portrait of his generation. He was also known for his drug addiction, which he documented in his autobiographical books *Livealbum* and *Remix*.

In 2004, renowned photographer and filmmaker Herlinde Koelbl released a documentary about Stuckrad-Barre titled *Rausch und Ruhm* (Rush and Fame), which followed him for two years as he struggled with his addiction and tried to revive his career. The film was broadcasted on public television and received critical acclaim, but it also sparked controversy due to its intimate and unfiltered depiction of Stuckrad-Barre's life.
 
Since then, the documentary has become almost impossible to find online or offline. It is not available in any media library or streaming platform, nor on DVD or VHS. The reason for this is unclear, but some speculate that Stuckrad-Barre himself was unhappy with his portrayal and sued to have the film removed from circulation. Others suggest that the film's rights are held by the production company or the broadcaster, who have no interest in re-releasing it.
 
However, there are still some people who are interested in watching the documentary, either for research purposes or out of curiosity. They have tried to contact the director, the author, the broadcaster, and even the archives of the public television, but to no avail. The only hope is that someone somewhere has a copy of the film stored on a hard drive or a tape, and is willing to share it with the rest of the world.
 
If you are one of those people, or if you know someone who is, please let us know. We would love to see this rare and fascinating piece of German cultural history.
  
Meanwhile, Stuckrad-Barre himself has moved on from his past as a drug-addicted celebrity writer. He has published several books since his recovery, including *Panikherz*, *NÃ¼chtern am Weltnichtrauchertag*, and *Alle sind so ernst geworden*, in which he reflects on his life, his work, and his generation. He has also won awards for his journalism and interviews, such as the German Reporter Prize in 2013.
 
His latest book, *Noch wach?* (Still awake?), is a novel that revisits some of the themes and characters from his previous works, but also tackles new issues such as #MeToo, media power, and moral responsibility. The book has received mixed reviews from critics and readers, some praising it as a sharp and witty satire of the media industry and its protagonists, others criticizing it as a self-indulgent and narcissistic exercise in name-dropping and gossip.
 
Stuckrad-Barre himself has said that the book is not a memoir, but a fiction based on real events and people. He has also denied that he wanted to settle accounts with anyone or expose any secrets. He said he wanted to explore the question of how much truth there is in fiction, and how much fiction there is in truth.
